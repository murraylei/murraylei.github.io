== Welcome to My Site!


I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://smith.queensu.ca/index.php Smith School of Business] at [https://www.queensu.ca/ Queen's University]. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Management from the [https://michiganross.umich.edu/ Ross School of Business], [https://www.umich.edu/ University of Michigan] in 2018, where I was fortunate to have been advised by [https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/sjasin1/ Stefanus Jasin] and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitabh-sinha-22b86234 Amitabh Sinha]. In 2012, I received my bachelor degree from [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthu/index.html Tsinghua University]. During my junior year, I spent one semester at the [http://www.ust.hk/  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology] as an exchange student.

I am broadly interested in the intersection between business analytics and operations management. My research focuses on the development of provably near-optimal real-time prescriptive analytics solutions that are easily implementable in a dynamic business environment. My current work lies in the area of pricing and revenue management, and is motivated by real business problems that arise in the context of e-commerce/omnichannel retail and ondemand service platforms.

== Welcome to My Site!


I am an Assistant Professor in the Smith School of Business at Queen's University. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Management from the Ross School of Business,  University of Michigan in 2018, where I was fortunate to have been advised by Stefanus Jasin and Amitabh Sinha. In 2012, I received my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University. 

I am broadly interested in the intersection between business analytics and operations management. My research focuses on the development of provably near-optimal real-time prescriptive analytics solutions that are easily implementable in practice. My current work lies in the area of pricing and revenue management, and is motivated by real business problems that arise in the context of e-commerce/omnichannel retail and ondemand service platforms.

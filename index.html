<h2>Welcome to My Site!</h2>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Smith School of Business at Queen's University. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Management from the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan in 2018. In 2012, I received my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University. </p>
<p>I am broadly interested in the intersection between business analytics and operations management. My current research focuses on (i) developing provably near-optimal real-time prescriptive analytics solutions that are easily implementable in practice, and (ii) understanding how to make data-driven analytics better aligned with societal values, especially privacy, fairness, and sustainability. My current work lies in the area of revenue management and supply chain management, and is often motivated by real business problems that arise in the context of retail operations and ondemand service platforms.</p>

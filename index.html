<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Murray Lei is an Associate Professor of Management Analytics and Distinguished Research Fellow of Management Analytics in the Smith School of Business at Queen's University. He received his Ph.D. in Operations Management from the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan in 2018 and bachelor degree in Automation from Tsinghua University in 2012.</p>
<p>Murray is broadly interested in the intersection between business analytics and operations management. My current research focuses on (i) developing data-driven algorithms for real-time decision-making under uncertainty, and (ii) understanding how to make data-driven analytics better aligned with societal values, especially privacy, fairness, and sustainability. My current work lies in the area of revenue management and supply chain management, and is often motivated by real business problems that arise in the context of retail operations and on-demand service platforms.</p>
<p>Murray’s teaching interests span Business Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Operations Management, Supply Chain Management, and Revenue Management. He has extensive experience teaching these subjects across various academic levels, including executive educations, professional graduate programs (such as Master of Management Analytics), research-based graduate programs (M.Sc. and Ph.D.), and undergraduate courses. He has been selected by students in the MMA programs as the Professor of the Year.</p>
